# CSC-347-Concepts-of-Programming-Languages


Syntax of programming languages: regular expressions, finite automata, context-free grammars, parsing. Scoping, binding, parameter passing, exception handling. Declarative programming languages. Typing, polymorphism. Runtime systems: dynamic loading, byte-code verification, security managers, garbage collection, versioning.

Programming paradigms and language concepts: functional programming;
comparison of object-oriented languages; type systems for functional and
object-oriented languages; runtime systems for functional and objectoriented
languages. A variety of programming languages will be used to
illustrate concepts, e.g., C, C++, Haskell, JavaScript, Ruby, Rust, Scala,
Scheme.
